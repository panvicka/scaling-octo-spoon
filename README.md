# Scrimba - The Weekly Web Dev Challenge

I am following Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenges. I find the challenges **relatively** easy so I always add some more functionality and fun to them! I like how scalable they are and they keep me coding regularly. 

I like to come back and correct the mistakes I made several weeks ago when I did not know better. It makes me feel like I have learned something! 

So here are my solutions! 

### Week 1: A cool rating app
### Week 2: String Calculator
### Week 3: Fix the form
### Week 4: Flip Card
### Week 5: Logo Editor
### Week 6: Responsive News Cards (mobile + tablet + desktop)

### Week 7: Magic squares
